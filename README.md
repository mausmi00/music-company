# music-company
This is a part of the final project I worked on for CPSC304. This project is not meant to be duplicated for the purposes of graded coursework.

Has been built using PHP and uses Oracle for database.

This music company has a collection of record labels, each of which can have multiple agents who manage a contract bound to a particular group that can consist of one or more artists. 
These groups can perform on shows along with other artists or also go on tours.
